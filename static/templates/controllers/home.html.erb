      <h2>Highlevel</h2>
        <p>
          <b>snorkel</b> answers questions about the <b>here</b> and <b>now</b>.
          You can think of snorkel like an <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP</a>
          with amnesia. Snorkel stores <b>raw samples</b> in <b>datasets</b> and
          dynamically slices and aggregates them in real time. As the samples
          age, they will <b>automatically expire</b>, keeping query times snappy.

        </p>

      <h2>When do I sample data?</h2>
        <p>
          Typically, datasets tend to hold a few weeks worth of information. If
          you find that your samples are not sticking around for long enough,
          you should consider <b>sampling</b> the data down and adding a
          <b>weight</b> or <b>sample_rate</b> field that represents that
          sample's weight. Snorkel does the right thing and
          will account for the sample rate when doing its aggregations.
