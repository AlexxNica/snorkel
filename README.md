snorkel
=======

<b>snorkel</b> is a real time data analysis  tool,  meant  to  answer  questions
about the *now*.  At it's heart, snorkel is built on  the  idea  that  iterative
analysis is key to understanding.  In other words - when graphs move, it  should
be easy to drill down on what is happening and why, not a frustrating  exercise
in adjusting failed queries.
